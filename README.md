PLEASE READ THIS.  I have finished this Hackathon Project which is made using Next.JS. TO make it responsive I used max width to my flex boxes and changed it on different break points, I think this way is far superior then using Grid. I went with the mobile First approach. I tried to clone the website as Pixel perfect as I could. I have Only made the home Page.  I have a very busy schedule because of my A-levels however I have completed this without using Chat-GPT or any other source everything is my own. nothing is that special I didn't add any functionality it is very static but is fully Responsive. I hope you guys assess the project fairly and don't let people who cheated get ahead of others who didn't.
